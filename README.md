# Project: Data Flow

## Data Mapping Flow Analysis Tool

<img src="./data_clump_flow_app/images/icon128.png" align="right" width="64" height="64">

The "Data Mapping Flow Analysis Tool" was conceptualized when analyzing a variety of `Jenkinsfile`s from multiple sources, and the environments, stages, and flows within each.

> Online App: [kdcinfo.com/app/dataflow/](https://kdcinfo.com/app/dataflow/)

- The primary thought was to try to keep the flow simple (a sticking point in previous flow-recording app attempts):
  - Cell content: Title.
  - Cell content: Data clump that can be expanded.
- Data nodes are either linked to, or simply follow other cells.
- Initialized: Nov 2024

## Function Flow

The "Function Flow" code was conceptualized when I was analyzing various function flows within an app.

> This app is unfinished (barely started, actually)

- This flow attempted to capture multiple functional flows throughout an app.
- It focused on attempting to link functions based on relevant flow points.
- Initialized: Mar 2024
